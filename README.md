# Ecommerce Back End

## Summary

This app is a representation of a back end for an e-commerce website. It uses a few models for Category, Product, and Tag to house example items that might be for sale on the site. The models represent tables in our database. They are linked with a  through table. 

The app will allow the user to view all Categories, Products, and Tags, or view a specific Category, Product, or Tag by using its corresponding ID number. It also allows the user to update an entry in any table, add a new entry, or delete an entry by using its ID number.
